# hw2
This is the second programming assignment of the computer science track for Paragon National Group. The questions will cover the topics learned in the second lecture, which entailed recursive functions, for and while loops, string indexing, and linked lists.

Carefully read over the specifications of each function that is given in the header description.

# Tasks
A skeleton is provided for each task, and your job is to fill it out. The parts where you need to fill it out is marked as "TODO".

**iterative_palindrome**

This function takes a natural number as an argument (so it can't be negative) and returns a boolean value of true or false that shows whether the inputted number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is something that reads the same backward as forward (i.e. '2002'). Use a for or while for the implementation of this function.

**recurisve_palindrome**

This function is the same as iterative_palindrome() except instead of using a loop, implement the function in a recursive way.

**factorial**

Helper function for sum_factorials(). Takes a number as an argument and returns the factorial of that number.

**is_prime**

Helper function for sum_factorials(). Takes a number as an argument and returns a boolean value of true or false that shows whether the inputted number is a prime or not.

**sum_factorials**

This function takes a pointer to the head node of the linked list as an argument and returns the sum of factorials of prime numbers in the linked list. Above are two helper functions for this that are highly recommended.

# Submitting the Code
